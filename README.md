Overview
This project solves the 8-Puzzle problem using a simple Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm.
The puzzle is represented as a 3×3 grid with numbers 1–8 and one empty space (0).
The program finds the shortest sequence of moves needed to reach the goal state.
It is written in Python in a clear, student-friendly manner.

Features
1. Solves the 8-Puzzle using BFS
2. Always finds the shortest solution path
3. Simple string-based puzzle representation
4. Easy-to-read and beginner-friendly code
5. Shows all steps from start state to goal state
